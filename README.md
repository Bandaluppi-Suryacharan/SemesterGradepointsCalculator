# SemesterGradepointsCalculator

I have developed a Semester Gradepoints calculator using Frontend Technologies(Html,Css,JavaScript)
In this Project,I have used Html and Css for a designing  static webpage containing Name,Semester and Courses-You have to enter them...
On entering the number of subjects i.e by clicking on submit it will dynamically generates the subject name and mark details using JavaScript.
After entering the subject details and clicking on submit it will generates the result page containg the subjectname and garade point detailswith Average grade points at end.

# Grade Point calculation:
I have considered two internal exams(mid1,mid2) and sem exam for each subject.
Internals = 80% of highest mid mark + 20%/ of lowest mid marks(out of 40marks for each)
Externals =out of 60marks
Total Marks = Internals + Externals

Finally Assigning the Grade ponits according to the norms of grades calculation based on Total marks and its average.
